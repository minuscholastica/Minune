# About Me

![Minu](/Minu2.jpeg)

These days, I think about a chicken-and-egg problem while engaging with a cool startup: using AI to transform how we handle data, which is essential to better use of AI. On the side, I enjoy crafting narratives that makes complex tech accessible.

Originally from South Korea, I relocated to Singapore to study Intellectual History and Computational Physics at Yale-NUS College. Since then, I've tackled a few exciting projects - here are some:

- **Woochi:** AI-powered regulatory compliance solutions leveraging successful ISO compliance experience.
- **PreternaturalAI:** Conceptual documentation on text embedding and RAG pipelines for AI newcomers.
- **Nervotec:** Product management and ISO 13485, FDA, and HSA compliance at AI-driven digital health startup.
- **HubSpot:** Strategic CRM consulting for startups, scaling sales operations and customer retention.
- **Digital Numismatics Research:** Image detection algorithm optimization for Roman coin classification.

I'm always on the lookout to explore exciting problems, solutions, and, of course, effective ways to capture such insights. Drop me a message if any of this resonates with you!
