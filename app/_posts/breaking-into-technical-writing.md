**Breaking into technical writing can be challenging, but it's not impossible.**
Here are some strategies that might help you transition into this field, even without prior technical writing experience.

> [!note] Technical writing is a broad field that encompasses various types of documentation in the tech industry, from API documentation to regulatory compliance reports.

How can you break into this field? Here are some key strategies:

1. **Target startups**
   - Many startups need technical writers but may not list it as a specific role.
   - They're often more flexible with experience requirements if you can demonstrate your skills.

2. **Understand the breadth of "technical writing"**
   - SaaS companies often use "technical writer" as a catch-all term for various writing needs.
   - This can include regulatory documentation, marketing content, and more.
   - Highlight your experience with software products or marketing to show transferable skills.

3. **Build a relevant portfolio**
   - Demonstrate familiarity with industry-specific tools and templates.
   - Examples include:
     - Technology radar (like [ThoughtWorks' Tech Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-sg/radar))
     - C4 diagrams ([C4 Model](https://c4model.com/))
   - Show how your general writing skills are applicable to tech contexts.

4. **Focus on Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) documentation**
   - SDLC documentation is in high demand.
   - Familiarize yourself with [SDLC documentation practices](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/how-do-you-create-manage-sdlc-documentation).

5. **Research industry-specific regulatory requirements**
   - If you're targeting a specific industry, learn about its documentation needs.
   - For example:
     - Healthtech: ISO, FDA, CE certifications
     - AI: Emerging compliance documentation requirements

6. **Explore API and code documentation**
   - If interested in this area, study existing samples.
   - Create documentation for your own projects to build a portfolio.

Remember, your existing writing skills are valuable. The key is to demonstrate how they apply to technical contexts and show your willingness to learn industry-specific tools and practices.
