**ISO 13485 compliance can be a single Notion page.**
We just received ours at Nervotec, my ex-workplace. ðŸŽ‰

As the project lead, I was excited to hear the news just days before moving on to my new chapter.

<CalloutBox type="tip" heading="What in the World is ISO13485"> For those unfamiliar, ISO 13485 is the regulatory standard for Medical Device quality management systems. It's almost a prerequisite for startups in healthcare, often determining market entry, but can be a beast of a certification. </CalloutBox>

How beastly are we talking? 

Imagine a standard with 8 sections and over 100 sub-clauses. Each demands procedure summaries, instructions, and records - all with unique identifiers needing constant updates. 

A bigger problem is such records usually sit in Google Drive, requiring updates to be largely manual. Someone inevitably becomes a reluctant document police.

**We needed a better solution, and that's why, a new platform.**

Everything was re-created under Notion, streamlined and automated as I experimented with different tools. This ultimately condensed all requirements into a single Notion page with five inline databases. Records were automatically pulled in, labeled, and organized as they were created.

**This is possibly one of the first Notion-based quality management systems out thereâ€”and it got us certified.**

But the journey to be compliant was so much more than a Notion-based system.

There were many takeaways that stuck with me, and here are a few:

1. **Software as Medical Device (SaMD) is a relatively new territory for ISO**, especially with the AI component. 

   I found this awareness useful to navigate grey areas while staying true to the core product.

2. **ISO is a helpful anchor to company-wide restructuring.** We used ISO to optimize our processes, and it was effective. 

   Automated workflow makes it easy to automate document control, which means easier compliance.

3. **Once we cracked ISO, FDA and HSA felt like dÃ©jÃ  vu.** 

   The process is more repeatable than I initially thought. Here, I see real opportunity to make AI-driven streamlining across regulatory bodies possible.

4. **A Notion-based platform for quality management is useful, and a great start to more effective tools.** 

   Building this got me thinking of a few ways to make the workflow even simpler, with or without Notion.

Plowing through regulatory compliance firsthand for the past 1.5 years, I spent a lot of time thinking about how to simplify it. There's a clear need for better tools and automationâ€”partly why I chose my next chapter to be directly in the AI space.

While I'm moving on from Nervotec and the healthcare sector (for now ðŸ˜‰), I plan to keep working on the side for ways to make regulatory compliance manageable for companies, particularly early-stage startups. Currently building an AI-assisted application for compliance that might be fun! 

I will definitely share more as I go. 

Ah, and here's the said certificate - seeing is believing:
