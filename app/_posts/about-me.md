These days, I think about a chicken-and-egg problem while engaging with a cool startup: using AI to transform how we handle data, which is essential to better use of AI. On the side, I enjoy crafting narratives that makes complex tech accessible.

Originally from South Korea, I relocated to Singapore to study Intellectual History and Computational Physics at Yale-NUS College. Since then, I've tackled a few exciting projects - here are some:

> [!note] 
>
> - [**Woochi:**](https://www.woochi.ai) AI-powered regulatory compliance solutions leveraging successful ISO compliance experience.
>
> - [**PreternaturalAI:**](https://preternatural.ai) Conceptual documentation on text embedding and RAG pipelines for AI newcomers.
> - [**Nervotec:**](https://www.nervotec.com) Product management and ISO 13485, FDA, and HSA compliance at AI-driven digital health startup.
> - [**HubSpot:**](https://www.hubspot.com) Strategic CRM consulting for startups, scaling sales operations and customer retention.
> - [**Digital Numismatics Research:**](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/story/20-november-2020-yale-nus-students-step-outside-their-majors-to-embark-on-interdisciplinary-research-projects/) Image detection algorithm optimization for Roman coin classification. (Publication in review)

Some papers I've worked on:

> - [**Numerical simulation of microscopic thermalization in a one-dimensional harmonically trapped gas coupled to a chain of masses**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=Mf6g9jUAAAAJ&citation_for_view=Mf6g9jUAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC)
> - [**Development and Validation of remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) Technology for Blood Pressure and Hemoglobin Level Assessment in the Preoperative Assessment Setting**](https://preprints.jmir.org/preprint/60455)

I'm always on the lookout to explore exciting problems, solutions, and, of course, effective ways to capture such insights. 

Drop me a message if any of this resonates with you, would love to chat!
