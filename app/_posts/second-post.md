I've always wanted to build a custom website, free from any hosting platform. Here's a really simple way of doing it with my snippets of code:

That said, how cool is the light/dark mode! 

Work in progress cause I sleepy:

1. Change the meta data favicon
2. For blog posts, the light mode doesn't convert the text to black 
3. MD file's image processing sucks 
4. Add cute home emoj next to Home
5. Different effect for when hovering over blog post
6. Refine the About me text - and while we're at it, rethink the navigation terms
7. While we're at it, rethink the blog title 
8. For every blog post, there should be a concluding section - kinda feels weird for posts to end without any chunks of space below
9. Probably more...
